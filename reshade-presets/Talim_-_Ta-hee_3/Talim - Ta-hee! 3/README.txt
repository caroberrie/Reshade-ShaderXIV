Welcome to TalimsTahee 3!

!!!!!!!!!!!>>>>IMPORTANT<<<<<!!!!!!!!!!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The preset are only available on my Discord Server "TalimsTahee"
Please do not upload my presets in any other way!
All my presets have a hidden copyright/watermark, so don't try to pass them off as your own, I can check that easily.
Editing presets for your personal preference is totally fine, sharing edited versions is NOT.
I created my presets over several days, be respectul to the work of other people.

Other than that:
I hope you enjoy TalimsTahee 3, I put a lot of effort and heart in it, thank you for all your support until now!

HOW TO INSTALL TEXTURES:

You find the Textures in this Folder, they are named after the Preset they belong to. "The Main"- Preset got an extra folder.

SQUAREENIX > FINALFANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn > game > gshade-shaders > Textures

Copy the Textures out of the TalimsTahee 3 Texture Folder, into the "Textures" Folder from Gshade. 
DO NOT COPY THE FOLDER ITSELF!

In the shaderlist, you see a shader named "STAGEDEPTH" 

Check out #tutorials > Pins (Top Right)
>
> NEW METHOD FOR TEXTURE PRESETS <

There you can see how to insert Textures into the stagedepth files. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL SHADERS:

♦♦♦
MANY PRESETS ARE MADE TO WORK WITH THE SHADER "NONLOCALMEANS", this is a shader that smoothes the textures.
This Shader will be ♥OFF♥, when you first open the preset, because it is heavy for your CPU.
If you don't want to use nonlocal, just adjust the sharpening shaders to your liking (mostly at the top), because they are set  higher to make sure
you still have a sharp picture, if you use "NONLOCALMEANS"!
♦♦♦

Some of my presets have disabled shaders in the shaderlist. 
I recommand trying out what fits best to your setting.
I don't recommand to always enable everything without thinking, just try around and find out, what every shader does!
You ♦CAN♦ enable every shader, but I think it is important for you to know what the shader in the preset does!

LIGHTING HELP

You can find lighting tutorials on my discord: > #tutorials

Basic Tip:  My pic is too bright, My pic is too dark:  Gpose menu, First Site: Manual Brightness Adjustments

♦PRESET: "THE MAIN"♦
LIGHTING EXAMPLE:

To get optimal results, you got a light source from the left and from the right. 
So you position Gpose Light from those positions OR from backright, backleft.
The 3. light can be placed directly on your character (white light, natural light or another color to create more interesting effects)
Consider the color, of your light source.
Try around with Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3.
There is no formula I can give you, because you have your personal preference anyway.

Keep in mind that I might have another ♦GAMMA Setting than you are. 
You can simply use♦"Manual Brightness Adjustment"♦ in the Gpose Menu in General Settings to balance stuff out.
You should consider these steps for every screenshot, not only for "The Main"

#help Channel in Discord

♦I am scared to touch the optional Shaders!
There is no need to, to improve your pictures it is better for you to know what shader does.
Other than that, I can guide you through, if you having trouble. #help-Channel in discord

♦Can I change this preset for personal use?
Yes
♦ Can I upload the changed preset?
No.

♦ It's not looking like your pics!
Graphic Settings, Enviorment, Lighting - as long as your screen is not black-green dotted and totally different, not much I can do.

♦ I love your shaders!
