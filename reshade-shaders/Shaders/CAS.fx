//Initial port to ReShade: SLSNe	https://gist.github.com/SLSNe/bbaf2d77db0b2a2a0755df581b3cf00c

//Optimizations by Marty McFly:
//	vectorized math, even with scalar gcn hardware this should work
//	out the same, order of operations has not changed
//	For some reason, it went from 64 to 48 instructions, a lot of MOV gone
//	Also modified the way the final window is calculated
//	  
//	reordered min() and max() operations, from 11 down to 9 registers	
//
//	restructured final weighting, 49 -> 48 instructions
//
//     delayed RCP to replace SQRT with RSQRT
//
//	removed the saturate() from the control var as it is clamped
//	by UI manager already, 48 -> 47 instructions
//
//	replaced tex2D with tex2Doffset intrinsic (address offset by immediate integer)
//	47 -> 43 instructions
//	9 -> 8 registers

//Further modified by OopyDoopy and Lord of Lunacy:
//	Changed wording in the UI for the existing variable and added a new variable and relevant code to adjust sharpening strength.

//Fix by Lord of Lunacy:
//	Made the shader use a linear colorspace rather than sRGB, as recommended by the original AMD documentation from FidelityFX.

//Modified by CeeJay.dk:
//	Included a label and tooltip description. I followed AMDs official naming guidelines for FidelityFX.
//
//	Used gather trick to reduce the number of texture operations by one (9 -> 8). It's now 42 -> 51 instructions but still faster
//	because of the texture operation that was optimized away.

//Fix by CeeJay.dk
//	Fixed precision issues with the gather at super high resolutions
//	Also tried to refactor the samples so more work can be done while they are being sampled, but it's not so easy and the gains
//	I'm seeing are so small they might be statistical noise. So it MIGHT be faster - no promises.
